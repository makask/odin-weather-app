# odin-weather-app

The purpose of this weather application was to use API calls to fetch data 
from weather forecast site (https://www.weatherapi.com/) and display this 
data on my own website. The aim was also to show how to use javascript async await 
functionality.

# how-to-use
Since I didn't want to reveal the api key, in order to use this page you have to get
your api key from the page https://www.weatherapi.com/. Navigate to project folder 
src-> serverData.js and paste your api key to the requested place:
